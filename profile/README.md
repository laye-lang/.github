# Laye

Laye is a programming language designed to be used alongside C. Where many languages aim to be a C replacement, Laye instead wants to co-exist in its own unique manner. This relationship is so important that the Laye compiler, `layec`, is also a C compiler.

This is the Laye Programming Language Organization, a shared space for repositories relating to the Laye programming language. The most important repositorys are pinned below. If you have any question, feel free to open up a new discussion or join the [`Forever Untitled Studios`](https://discord.gg/NRvbFDNKjV) Discord server.
